In the following policy, we inform you about the most important aspects of data processing on our website.</p>

        <h2>2. Controller, Contact, and Data Protection Contact Person</h2>
        <p>
            The party responsible for data processing on this website (the **Controller** pursuant to Art. 4 No. 7 GDPR) is:

        </p>

        <h2>3. Server Log Files and Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our website, the hosting provider automatically collects information in the context of so-called "Server Log Files." This data is technically necessary and includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address and Hostname</li>
            <li>Date and time of the server request</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL (previously visited website)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            **Purpose:** To ensure the technical security, stability, and reliable provision of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Legal Basis:** Our overriding **legitimate interest** (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in the technical security and smooth operation of the site.
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            **Retention and Deletion:** Server log files are stored for a maximum period of **7 days** to ensure system stability and security. They are then automatically deleted unless required for evidence purposes (e.g., in the event of a cyber-attack or legal proceedings).
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Our website uses cookies. We categorize the cookies we use as follows, in accordance with the ePrivacy Directive (TKG 2021):
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.1. Necessary Cookies (Technical Functionality)</h3>
        <p>
            These cookies are essential for the basic function of the website (e.g., storing your cookie consent status). They are processed based on **Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR** (legitimate interest) as the website cannot function correctly without them. Your prior consent is not required.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2. Non-Essential Cookies (Statistical/Marketing)</h3>
        <p>
            These cookies are used for statistical analysis (e.g., Google Analytics) or marketing purposes. These are only set and processed if you provide your **explicit consent** via our Cookie Consent Tool (Opt-in). The legal basis is your **Consent** (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            **Consent Documentation:** Your consent status and the time of consent are logged by our system for compliance purposes (Art. 7 Para. 1 GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            **Withdrawal of Consent:** You have the right to revoke your consent at any time, effective for the future, via the "**Change Cookie Settings**" link in the footer of the website. Revoking consent will stop future tracking and associated non-essential data processing.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Processing by Third Parties (Formspree & US Data Transfer)</h2>
        <p>
            To securely process inquiries submitted through our contact form, we use the service **Formspree**, provided by Formspree, Inc., located in the USA.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Processing Purpose:** Processing your inquiry for pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.1. Transfer to a Third Country (USA) and Safeguards</h3>
        <p>
            Your data (name, email address, message) is transferred to Formspree’s servers in the **USA**. The USA is a third country without an adequate level of data protection according to EU standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            This transfer carries the **risk** that your data could be subject to access by US authorities (e.g., under FISA 702) without effective legal remedies being available to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Protection Measures:** To ensure appropriate safeguards, we rely on the implementation of **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** issued by the EU Commission, combined with additional technical and organizational measures, as agreed with Formspree, Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            **Legal Basis for Transfer:** By submitting the form and explicitly checking the consent box, you **expressly consent** to this data transfer despite the identified risks (Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            Further information on data processing and privacy protection by Formspree can be found in their privacy policy: <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy" target="_blank">https://formspree.io/legal/privacy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Contact with us (Email)</h2>
        <p>
            If you contact us via email, the data you transmit (e.g., email address, content of the message) will be stored for the purpose of processing your request and follow-up communication. The legal basis is our **legitimate interest** (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in handling your inquiry efficiently.
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            **Retention:** Data is stored for six months or for as long as necessary to fulfill the inquiry or is subject to statutory retention periods.
        </p>
