        <h2>3. Server Log Files and Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> This website is hosted by <strong>GitHub Inc.</strong> (88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, <strong>USA</strong>)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Processing and Logs:</strong> When you visit our website, the hosting provider automatically collects information in the context of so-called "Server Log Files." This data is technically necessary and includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Date and time of the server request</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL (previously visited website)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure the technical security, stability, and reliable provision of our website (e.g., to detect and prevent DDoS attacks).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Transfer to the USA:</strong> Since GitHub is a US-based company, data (such as your IP address) may be processsed on servers located in the United States. We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with GitHub. Furthermore, the data transfer is safeguarded by the <strong>EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF)</strong>, to which GitHub (as a subsidiary of Microsoft) adheres, or strictly via Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), combined with technical security measures such as robust TLS/SSL encryption for all data transmission, to ensure GDPR compliance.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Our overriding <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in the technical security and smooth operation of the site.
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            <strong>Retention and Deletion:</strong> We <strong>do not have direct access</strong> to these log files. However, GitHub may retain these logs for a limited period for security and incident-investigation purposes in accordance with their privacy policy. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Our website currently <strong>does not use any cookies or comparable tracking technologies</strong>. Therefore, no processing of personal data for statistical or marketing purposes takes place via cookies, and no cookie consent is required or logged.
        </p>


        <h2>5. Data Processing by Third Parties (Formspree & US Data Transfer)</h2>
        <p>
            To securely process inquiries submitted through our contact form, we use the service <strong>Formspree</strong>, provided by Formspree, Inc., located in the <strong>USA</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Processing Purpose:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Processing your inquiry for <strong>pre-contractual measures</strong> (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).</li>
                <li><strong>Spam prevention and security</strong> of the contact form (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).</li>
                <li>Internal record-keeping and evidence purposes (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Processing data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <strong>1. Content Data:</strong> Name, email address, content of the message.<br>
                <strong>2. Technical Meta-data:</strong> IP address, User-Agent (browser type/version), and Referrer URL.
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="retention-note">
            <strong>Retention by Processor (Formspree):</strong> We have configured Formspree to <strong>disable the Submission Archive feature</strong>. Therefore, Formspree <strong>does not store</strong> the submitted message content (text inputs, name, email) in their inbox archive longer than necessary to forward the email.. Data is immediately processed and forwarded to us. However, Formspree retains <strong>technical transmission logs (specifically IP addresses and browser info)</strong> for a limited time solely for security and spam prevention purposes.
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            <strong>Retention by Controller (Hana Energy):</strong> Data received via the contact form and stored in our internal systems (e.g., email inbox) is kept for <strong>six months</strong> to fulfil the inquiry, or for longer if necessary to comply with statutory retention periods (e.g., commercial or tax law obligations).
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.1. Transfer to a Third Country (USA) and Safeguards</h3>
        <p>
            Your data (including IP address, name, email address, message) is transferred to Formspree’s servers in the <strong>USA</strong>. The USA is a third country without an adequate level of data protection according to EU standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Risk:</strong> The USA is assessed a a third country. While the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) exists, transfers to non-certified US companies may carry the risk that your data could be <strong>subject to access by US authorities (e.g., under FISA 702)</strong> without effective legal remedies being available to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Protection Measures:</strong> To ensure appropriate safeguards, we rely on the implementation of <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> issued by the EU Commission, combined with additional technical and organizational measures, as agreed with Formspree, Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Legal Basis for Transfer:</strong> By submitting the form and explicitly checking the consent box, you <strong>expressly consent</strong> to this data transfer (including the transfer of your IP address) despite the identified risks (Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Right to Erasure</strong>: You have the right to request the deletion of data submitted via the contact form at any time. To exercise this right, please contact the Controller directly via email: <strong>contact@hanaenergy.at</strong>.
        </p>
