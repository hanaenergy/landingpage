        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Information Obligation Statement</p>

        <h2>1. General Data Processing</h2>
        <p>In the following privacy policy, we inform you about the most important aspects of data processing within the scope of our website.

        <h2>3. Server Log Files</h2>
        <p>This website and the associated provider automatically collect information during website use in the context of so-called "Server Log Files." This concerns in particular:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>The browser used</li>

            <li>Language settings and operating system</li>
            <li>ISP (Internet Service Provider)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The processing of this data is necessary to ensure the technical security and functionality of the website, to evaluate system stability and security, and to comply with legal documentation obligations. **The legal basis is our overriding legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in the technical security and reliable provision of our website.** This information is generally not processed personally or linked to personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Our website uses so-called cookies. These are small text files that are stored on your device using the browser. They serve to make our offer user-friendly. We categorize the cookies we use as follows:
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.1. Necessary Cookies (Technical Functionality)</h3>
        <p>
            These cookies are essential for the basic function of the website (e.g., storing the current session or your chosen language). **They are processed based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest) as the website cannot function correctly without them. Your prior consent is not required.**
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2. Non-Essential Cookies (Statistical/Marketing)</h3>
        <p>
            **These cookies are used for statistical analysis, market research, or personalized content (e.g., Google Analytics). These cookies are only used if you provide your explicit consent via our Cookie Consent Tool (Opt-in). The legal basis is your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 96 Para. 3 TKG / TTDSG).**
        </p>
        <p>
            **You have the right to revoke your consent at any time, effective for the future, via the "Change Cookie Settings" link in the footer of the website.** Deactivating these cookies does not affect the basic functionality of the website.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Processing by Third Parties (Formspree & US Data Transfer)</h2>
        <p>
            To process inquiries submitted through the contact form on our website, we use the service **Formspree**, provided by Formspree, Inc., **located in the USA.**
        </p>
        <p>
            The data you transmit (name, email address, message) is transferred to Formspree’s servers for processing your inquiry and is then forwarded to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            **The legal basis for this processing is your voluntary consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR), which you give by submitting the form, and for the performance of pre-contractual measures (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b GDPR) to handle your request.**
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.1. Transfer to a Third Country (USA)</h3>
        <p>
            **The USA is a third country without an adequate level of data protection according to the EU standards. Due to US surveillance laws (e.g., FISA 702), US intelligence agencies may access data transferred to Formspree. This transfer carries the risk that your data could be processed by US authorities for control and monitoring purposes without effective legal remedies being available to you.**
        </p>
        <p>
            **To ensure appropriate safeguards for this transfer, we rely on the implementation of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) issued by the EU Commission, combined with additional technical and organizational measures.** By submitting the form, you expressly consent to this data transfer despite the identified risks (Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
            Further information on data processing and privacy protection by Formspree can be found in their privacy policy: <a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy" target="_blank">https://formspree.io/legal/privacy</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>6. Contact with us (Email)</h2>
        <p>If you contact us via email, the data you transmit to us will be stored for six months for the purpose of processing your request or for the case of further follow-up questions. Your transmitted data will not be passed on without your consent. **The legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in handling your inquiry efficiently.**</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights as Data Subject</h2>
        <p>As the data subject, you fundamentally have the right to: Information (Art. 15), Deletion (Art. 17), Correction (Art. 16), Data Portability (Art. 20), **Revocation of Consent (Art. 7)** and Objection to data processing (Art. 21), and Restriction (Art. 18).</p>
        <p>
            If you suspect that violations of data protection law have occurred in the course of processing your data, you have the option of lodging a complaint with us (contact@hanaenergy.at) or **the Austrian Data Protection Authority (Österreichische Datenschutzbehörde).**
