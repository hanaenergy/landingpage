        <h2>3. Server Log Files and Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our website, the hosting provider automatically collects information in the context of so-called "Server Log Files." This data is technically necessary and includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address and Hostname</li>
            <li>Date and time of the server request</li>
            <li>Browser type and version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL (previously visited website)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure the technical security, stability, and reliable provision of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Legal Basis:</strong> Our overriding <strong>legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR) in the technical security and smooth operation of the site.
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            <strong>Retention and Deletion:</strong> Server log files — including visitor IP addresses — are retained by GitHub for a limited period. While GitHub does not publicly disclose a fixed retention period for all IP logs, certain security-related logs (such as Git events) may be retained for up to <strong>7 days</strong>, and other logs may be kept longer for security and incident-investigation purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Cookies & Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            Our website uses cookies. We categorize the cookies we use as follows, in accordance with the ePrivacy Directive (TKG 2021):
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.1. Necessary Cookies (Technical Functionality)</h3>
        <p>
            These cookies are essential for the basic function of the website (e.g., storing your cookie consent status). They are processed based on <strong>Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR</strong> (legitimate interest). Your prior consent is not required.
        </p>
        
        <h3>4.2. Non-Essential Cookies (Statistical/Marketing)</h3>
        <p>
            These cookies are used for statistical analysis or marketing purposes. These are only set and processed if you provide your <strong>explicit consent</strong> via our Cookie Consent Tool (Opt-in). The legal basis is your <strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p class="retention-note">
            <strong>Consent Documentation:</strong> Your consent status and the time of consent are logged by our system for compliance purposes (Art. 7 Para. 1 GDPR).

        <h2>5. Data Processing by Third Parties (Formspree & US Data Transfer)</h2>
        <p>
            To securely process inquiries submitted through our contact form, we use the service <strong>Formspree</strong>, provided by Formspree, Inc., located in the USA.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            Your data (name, email address, message) is transferred to Formspree’s servers in the <strong>USA</strong>. The USA is a third country without an adequate level of data protection according to EU standards.

        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Protection Measures:</strong> To ensure appropriate safeguards, we rely on the implementation of <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> issued by the EU Commission, combined with additional technical and organizational measures, as agreed with Formspree, Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Legal Basis for Transfer:</strong> By submitting the form and explicitly checking the consent box, you <strong>expressly consent</strong> to this data transfer despite the identified risks (Art. 49 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>
